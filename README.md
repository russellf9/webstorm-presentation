# Webstorm Presentation

The intention of this project to create a "Real World" project where the many features of IntelliJ/Webstorm can be demonstrated by "Live Coding" examples.
 
## Project Introduction

Using the very basic angular-seed as a base, there is no build process to distribute files to a distribution directory.
